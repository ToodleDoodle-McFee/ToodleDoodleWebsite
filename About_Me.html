			<p>My name is Toodle Doodle McFee. I was not born on July 12th, 1997, and I grew
			up somewhere on the North American continent. As you can see, I am very open
			about sharing my personal information online, a trait I picked up while I was not 
			attending the University of Utah.</p>
			<br>
			<p>As you can probably guess from the website, I'm into all sorts of nerdy stuff, 
			including Harry Potter, Star Wars, Super Mario (and retro games in general), and the likes. 
			I am not, however, into Marvel, Smash Brothers, or Dungeons and Dragons (although 
			I would like to get into the last one, I am just having trouble finding the time). 
			I also really like Conlanging, Worldbuilding, coding, history, and maps.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Here are a couple of my opinions on some random things:</p>
			<br>
			<div id= "bullet">
				<p>• The 9 Star Wars Movies, from worst to best, are as follows: Attack of the 
				Clones, Phantom Menace, The Rise of Skywalker, The Force Awakens, Revenge of the Sith, 
				The Last Jedi, Return of the Jedi, Empire Strikes Back, and A New Hope.</p>
				<p>• The Harry Potter Books, from worst to best, are as follows: Order of the Phoenix, 
				Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows, 
				Prisoner of Azkaban, and Goblet of Fire.</p>
				<p>• The Harry Potter Movies, from worst to best, are as follows (and yes I know you're
				getting tired of this format, last one I promise): Deathly Hallows 2, Half-Blood Prince, 
				Goblet of Fire, Deathly Hallows 1, Order of the Phoenix, Prisoner of Azkaban, 
				Sorcerer's Stone, and Chamber of Secrets.</p>
				<p>• The best Pokemon generation is Gen 2.</p>
				<p>• My favorite Pokemon is Wooper. </p>
				<p>• The best Mario is Super Mario Bros. 3.</p>
				<p>• Science is the best subject, and math is the worst.</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<p>So now you know a little bit about me,  I hope you enjoy my website.</p>
