			<p>Explanation of some of the major changes by region (not necessarily in chronological order):</p>
			<br>
			<p>North America: </p>
			<p>As its politics became less and less reflective of Canada as a whole, Quebecois nationalism 
			began to grow, culminating in the government holding a referendum for Quebec become independent. 
			It succeeded by a fairly large margin, and a gradual transition to independence from Canada took place 
			over the following years, with the two countries remaining highly interconnected in many ways.</p>
			<p>The United States, while still fairly important on the world stage, has nevertheless lost quite a lot 
			of its power as China, India,  and several other lesser regional powers have gained it. After several 
			reactionary presidents under whose leadership the US fought to remain on top, America finally settled 
			into its position in the new, multi-polar world. Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. both gained statehood,
			 while Hawaii (whose Native people were influenced by the rise of the Neo-Traditionalist movement of 
			returning to historical forms of government) established a sub-national restoration of the monarchy.</p>
			
			<p>The Central American Federation, formed by a union between Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador 
			(and, after the South American War (see below) Nicaragua), is federal republic created with the intention 
			of increasing the influence of the Central American nations on the world stage. While the CAF aims to 
			someday incorporate all of Central America, Costa Rica currently has no intention of joining, as it is already 
			prosperous on its own thanks to its thriving tourism, and Panama has decided to wait in joining until a such 
			a time in which Costa Rica joins.</p>
			
			<p>In the Caribbean, the newly formed Caribbean Confederacy (consisting of most of the smaller Caribbean islands) 
			has become a tourism powerhouse in the region,  along with the newly democratized Cuba. Haiti, on the other hand, 
			has closed itself away from the world à la North Korea under a highly authoritarian monarchical dynasty.</p>
			<br>
			<p>South America: </p>
			
			<p>With the collapse of the Venezuelan regime, Colombia took over to help maintain order. While initially only meant to be a temporary occupation, both parties were fairly happy with the arrangement and remained united to form the Republic of Gran Colombia. Inspired by the success of this Union and that of the CAF, Guyana and Suriname (and later French Guiana, after gaining independence) united to form the multilingual Guyanan Union. </p>
			
			<p>Most of the change in South America, however, results from the South American War. With the rise of far right, nationalist, authoritarian leaders in Brazil and Chile, the two countries found themselves allied with the BRICKPACT, an authoritarian alliance led by China and Russia. Influenced by the rise of Neo-Traditionalism (especially within BRICKPACT), an aging Bolsonaro reinstated the monarchy (although mainly as a puppet) and proceeded to conquer Uruguay in attempt to "reunite the Empire." The Uruguayan government in exile fled to Argentina, asking for assistance in retaking their country. However, because of Brazil's support by BRICKPACT, the Argentineans were wary about provoking a war they felt they could not win. However, after being angered by the results of the Arusha Conference (explained further below, but in it China and Russia agreed not to support Brazil, or any of their Western hemisphere allies, in conquest attempts), the possibly senile Bolsanaro foolishly attacked Paraguay, which 
			called Argentina to action. Peru, Gran Colombia, and Bolivia (fearful of the power-hungry Brazil) also came to the aid of Argentina, while Chile, Cuba, and Nicaragua's authoritarian leaders all came to Brazil's aid. </p>
			
			<p>After a hard fought, brutal war (much of which took place in the steamy jungles of the Amazon), Brazil and its allies were defeated. Several of Brazil's western provinces were handed over to Bolivia and Gran Colombia, while Peru and Bolivia took parts of Northern Chile. The Guyanan Union, who had helped to support the Argentine Alliance financially, took Portuguese Guyana, while Nicaragua was integrated into the CAF and Cuba was democratized under the care of Gran Colombia. Chile was temporarily occupied and democratized under joint Peruvian-Bolivian control, and the same went for Brazil under Argentine control. Argentina held on to the Southern Brazilian provinces for several years after Brazil was granted independence as a constitutional monarchy, although they were eventually released as the independent Republic of South Brazil. Finally, the Amazon was put under direct United Nations control to preserve its great biodiversity and natural resources.</p>
